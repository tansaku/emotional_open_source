How Does Open Source Work?

The difference between open and closed source software; who pays for work on open source; examples of successful open source projects

So, open source software; different from closed source.  Closed source being where the code that runs the software is hidden, as opposed to being available to the general public to browse in some form.  In general terms that's it. Closed source software, also referred to as proprietary software, involves intentionally restricting access to the software code.  Usually access is restricted to employees of a particular company or organisation, or possibly to specific teams within those organisations.  Why would anyone want to restrict who looks at the raw code for a particular piece of software?

Conceivably if you're a company who's just paid some programmers a lot of money to write the code for the software and you are hoping that you will make at least some of that money back by selling the software you might well not want people to review that code by themselves, since they might be able to make the same software and sell it cheaper than you.  Or they might be able to package it up and just run it for themselves without needing to pay you.

In the early days there wasn't a clear concept of open and closed source.  Early computer hobbyists freely exchanged their software code.  Then software companies got in on the act and wanted to derive revenue from the software they were creating.  Other companies liked the idea of having a specific company responsible for the correct operation of their software, someone they could call for technical support and someone they could sue if things went really wrong.  This was the dominant model towards the end of the last century, but then it started to seem that even very large and powerful companies were having trouble keeping up with open source operating systems like Linux which operated on a completely different model.

The source code for Linux was freely available for anyone to look at and also the project was set up to welcome contributions for changes to the source code, and under the guidance of Linus Torvalds the operating system grew and improved and became a serious competitor for the then dominant closed source solutions.  These days it's a given that many organisations large and small will rely on open source operating systems like Linux, particularly in the cloud.  It wasn't always the case.  For a long time the received wisdom was that these hobbyist projects couldn't compete with proprietary systems for security or features.  In the long run however it's the open source systems that are more secure and robust because they can rely on a global community to help them evolve and adapt, rather than on the command and control structure of a single organisation spending most of its time trying to keep its secrets.

Now this doesn't mean that open source is a panacea solution for every software project.  Linux is a special case of timing and circumstances but it shows us what is possible; and there's still the question of who pays for all this work.  In recent years we've have the odd spectacle of tremendously wealthy multi-national corporations being dependent on the volunteer time of open source coders putting in efforts here and there on critical pieces of network infrastructure (https thing?).  Is open source software supposed to survive on the good will of programmers contributing in their spare time?  How are those programmers supposed to make money from their day jobs if we're replacing all proprietary software with open source ones?

There are various approaches to funding open source software which include, but are not limited to:

* Dual Licensing
* Selling Professional Services
* Selling of Branded Merchandise
* Selling of Certificates and Trademark Use
* Selling Software as a Service
* Partnership with Funding Organisations
* Voluntary Donations
* Bounty Driven Development
* Pre-Order/Crowdfunding/Reverse-Bounty MOdel
* Crowdsourcing
* Advertising Supported Software
* Selling of Optional Proprietary Extensions
* Selling of Required Proprietary Parts of a Software Product
* Selling of Proprietary Update Systems
* Re-licensing under a Proprietary License
* Obfuscation of Source Code
* Delayed Open Sourcing
* Open Sourcing on Ens od Life
