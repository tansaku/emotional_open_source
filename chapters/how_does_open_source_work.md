How Does Open Source Work?

The difference between open and closed source software; who pays for work on open source; examples of successful open source projects

So, open source software; different from closed source.  Closed source being where the code that runs the software is hidden, as opposed to being available to the general public to browse in some form.  In general terms that's it. Closed source software, also referred to as proprietary software, involves intentionally restricting access to the software code.  Usually access is restricted to employees of a particular company or organisation, or possibly to specific teams within those organisations.  Why would anyone want to restrict who looks at the raw code for a particular piece of software?

Conceivably if you're a company who's just paid some programmers a lot of money to write the code for the software and you are hoping that you will make at least some of that money back by selling the software you might well not want people to review that code by themselves, since they might be able to make the same software and sell it cheaper than you.  Or they might be able to package it up and just run it for themselves without needing to pay you.

In the early days there wasn't a clear concept of open and closed source.  Early computer hobbyists freely exchanged their software code.  Then software companies got in on the act and wanted to derive revenue from the software they were creating.  Other companies liked the idea of having a specific company responsible for the correct operation of their software, someone they could call for technical support and someone they could sue if things went really wrong.  This was the dominant model towards the end of the last century, but then it started to seem that even very large and powerful companies were having trouble keeping up with open source operating systems like Linux which operated on a completely different model.

The source code for Linux was freely available for anyone to look at and also the project was set up to welcome contributions for changes to the source code.
