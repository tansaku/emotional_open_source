How Does Open Source Work?

The difference between open and closed source software; who pays for work on open source; examples of successful open source projects

So, open source software; different from closed source.  Closed source being where the code that runs the software is hidden, as opposed to being available to the general public to browse in some form.  In general terms that's it. Closed source software, also called proprietary software, involves intentionally restricting access to the software code.  Usually access is restricted to employees of a particular company or organisation, or possibly to specific teams within those organisations.  Why would anyone want to restrict who looks at the raw code for a particular piece of software?

Conceivably if you're a company who's just paid some programmers a lot of money to write the code for the software and you are hoping that you will make at least some of that money back by selling the software you might well not want people to review that code by themselves, since they might be able to make the same software and sell it cheaper than you.
