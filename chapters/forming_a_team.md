Forming a Team
--------------

:construction: UNDER CONSTRUCTION :construction:

Exciting people about your idea; finding the right places to let people know what you are working on; onboarding new folks onto the team

One of the trickiest things about forming an open source team is the turnover of different contributors.  Some open source projects might have the luxury of lots of cash with which to pay a dedicated team of software developers, but even then it can be difficult to hold on to developers for more than 18 months as their lives change and new job opportunities arise.  At least on paid projects one presumes that you can get some consistent work done with a number of contributors for a few months.  Open source projects often rely on voluntary contributions made in folks spare time, meaning that you're competing with leisure activities such as watching television, or chores such as house-keeping and looking ofter children or elderly relatives.  In the ideal world governments might put money behind volunteering schemes so that people didn't feel overwhelmed trying to juggle voluntary contributions with the rest of their life, and of course some forward-thinking organisations allow their employees to spend part of their time on open source.

Still, even with some dedicated staff and highly committed volunteers, an open source project is open to everyone, and so one of the ongoing issues is dealing with contributions from folks all over the world and helping those people become regular contributors.  Your open source project might be starting with just you.  Those contributing, or looking to contribute, may only be intending to make a single short-term contribution, or they may be looking for (or become persuaded) to make a longer term committment.  The challenge is that there is no clear way of distinguishing one from the other, and a policy of friendly reception is one that will likely create the space for long-term contributors to appear.

The real trick is ensuring that you don't end up spending 800% of the time that would would making a series of small fixes, getting those same fixes from a string of different one-off contributors.  Although perhaps there isn't a premium on your time and you get real joy from working with a completely new person each day, in which case that's not a big deal.  However if you're similar to a good number of people in that you need to spend some time generating income in order to keep a roof over your head and food on the table for you (and possibly your dependents) then you might be looking to minimize the amount of time that you spend re-iterating the same information about your project to each new potential contributor.

Open source projects are often criticised for poor documentation, although there does seem to be a good proportion of people who will not read your documentation, however well you create and maintain it, and through whatever means you distribute it.  The difficulty with maintaining good documentation for technical projects is that technologies seem to be moving at a frenetic pace, and there are always new operating systems and browsers emerging; so the precise instructions you developed at one poin in time may well be hopelessly out of date before you know it.  Maintaining your technical documentation to best assist incoming contributors is likely as big a job as managing the software itself, and you thought you already had a lot to do :-)


Different kinds of contributors

* How can I help?
* I want to help given some contraints (e.g. only of technology X or with activity Y)
* I'm having trouble using the software
* I'm having trouble getting set up with the software for development
* I'm thinking of working on issues A, B or C, which would you prefer?
* I have a question about issue A
* I've started working on issue A and I'm stuck
* I've fixed issue A for you and here's a pull request
* I've fixed issue A for you and here's a pull request that meets your project specifications

Different kinds of documentation

* how to use this software
* how to install this software
* how to get setup with this software for development
* here's the background of this software
* aims and objectives of this project
* how to contribute to this project

Different places to access documentation and help

* README file on code repository
* CONTRIBUTING file on code repository
* text messaging to maintainer
* text chat room on irc/gitter/slack
* mailing list
* maintainers email
* forum such as stackoverflow
* issues board/tracker

As a project maintainer what you'd like to be able to avoid is re-typing out the answers to the same questions over and over again in private messages or in emails.   Different contributors will have different comfort levels about asking for help in different forums.  As a project maintainer I would always prefer that questions are asked in publicly visible issues on an open tracker, or in publicly visible forums such as mailing lists or group chat rooms.  However I've noticed that there seems to be a strong preference on the part of many individuals to reach out directly to maintainers via direct messaging or email.  This preference appears to be based on the following: 

* thinking that the maintainer is most likely to be able to answer the question
* thinking that the participants in group forums and channels will dislike "noise" from new contributors
* feeling embarressed about needing to ask a question that others will already know the answer to
* a general preference for one-to-one communication versus communication involving multiple parties

Assuming that a maintainer's individual contact email or direct message information can be found by existing and potential contributors, this can lead to maintainers becoming overwhelmed with this direct communication.  Of course as a maintainer you'll be hoping to make new participants feel welcome, and so immediately asking them to repeat their question in a different forum or channel can seem a little unfriendly, even if surrounded by friendly greetings.  The difficulty is that even requesting the the question be moved to a different location takes up time on the part of the maintainer.  In a team of individuals who regularly work together personal communication preferences can become part of the culture of the team.  However a continuing flow of new individuals who are defaulting to one-to-one communication can be extremely waring.  Particularly if the majority of those actually starting these one to one communications are then not actually going on to contribute anything to the project.

It makes a lot of sense to havea set of links to the relevant documentation to hand, so that as maintainer you can quickly link people to the information they need.  Along with the link you can add a request for your preferred mode of communication, but people's habits of preferring one-to-one communication can be extremely hard to break.  One clear option is simply to ignore all such communication ...
