Forming a Team

Exciting people about your idea; finding the right places to let people know what you are working on; onboarding new folks onto the team

One of the trickiest things about forming an open source team is the turnover of different contributors.  Some open source projects might have the luxury of lots of cach with which to pay a dedicated team of software developers, but even then it can be difficult to hold on to developers for more than 18 months as their lives change and new job opportunities arise.  At least on paid projects one presumes that you can get some consistent work done with a number of contributors for a few months.
